# Internship Projects @Fusion Informatics Ltd. 2019

### Project 1: Payroll Management System
Payroll Management is a distributed blockchain application, developed to evaluate the performance of employees working in any organization. It maintains the information about a company, personal details of their employees, also the project details assigned to a particular developer. The Payroll Management Application is developed using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain and coded using Hyperledger Composer framework.

### Project 2: Energy Trading
This application of Blockchain demonstrates energy sharing on a network among ‘Buildings’ on a grid. The Energy trade is based on exchanging Coins/Tokens for energy provided. Each building in the network is itself a producer/distributor of energy as well as consumer of energy.

### Project 3: Legalo: Business Contract
##### View Legalo in Detail: https://github.com/poojan-workspace/Legalo
Legalo is a web application specifically designed using blockchain technology to leverage its advantages like immutability and security. Using Legalo you can create various types of legal contracts like business contracts, consultancy contracts, rental contracts, etc by filing only important fields that matters and no need to worry about other legal technicalities. Upon creation of contracts on this application, corresponding immutable smart contracts are directly created on the blockchain that can never be modified once created.

### Project 4: Timelock
Create the contract from your secure eth address that you want to control the contract from, send funds to it to the default function from anywhere, and they'll be locked up to a year (or whatever you set the lockTime variable to).

### Project 5: Attendance Management
Blockchain Technology like 'Ethereum' is distributed and decentralized that make it can be applied to develop a tamper proof-employee attendance system. Conventional Systems do not have the feature to detect whether any particular records have experienced any unauthorized changes. On contrast, using Blockchain technology, no person can deny that he did changes to the database. The blockchain-based employee attendance system is required to provide a database that keeps its reliability and integrity and tamper proof. The control lies in every person that can access the Blockchain. But to make changes in it, every person has to accept the changes. So it is distributed and decentralized but at the same time more secure than the conventional systems.

#### This Projects are built using the following technologies:
 Solidity (Ethereum), Hyperledger Composer Rest Server, Hyperledger Fabric, Flask, JavaScript, NodeJS, Docker, HTML, CSS.
